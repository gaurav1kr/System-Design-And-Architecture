# Message Queue System

## Overview
This document provides a high-level and low-level design for a multithreaded message queue system. It includes architecture, APIs, services, and a C++ implementation utilizing modern C++ features, multithreading, and a thread pool.

## High-Level Design (HLD)

1. **Producer-Consumer Model**: 
   - Producers enqueue messages.
   - Consumers dequeue and process messages.
   
2. **Thread Pool**: 
   - Manages worker threads efficiently.
   
3. **Concurrency & Synchronization**: 
   - Uses `std::mutex` and `std::condition_variable`.
   
4. **Message Queue**: 
   - Implemented using `std::queue<T>`.
   
5. **Scalability**: 
   - Allows multiple producers and consumers.

## Low-Level Design (LLD)

### Classes
1. `MessageQueue<T>`:
   - Thread-safe queue with enqueue and dequeue operations.
   
2. `ThreadPool`:
   - Manages consumer threads.
   
3. `Producer`:
   - Generates and enqueues messages.
   
4. `Consumer`:
   - Dequeues and processes messages.

### Synchronization
- `std::condition_variable` for efficient waiting.
- `std::mutex` to prevent data races.

## APIs
1. **Enqueue Message**
   ```cpp
   void enqueue(T message);
   ```
2. **Dequeue Message**
   ```cpp
   T dequeue();
   ```
3. **Start Consumers**
   ```cpp
   void start();
   ```
4. **Shutdown Queue**
   ```cpp
   void shutdown();
   ```

## C++ Implementation
- Uses `std::thread` for concurrency.
- Thread pool manages consumer threads.
- `std::mutex` ensures thread safety.

## Usage
1. Start the application.
2. Enqueue messages.
3. Consumers process messages concurrently.
4. Shutdown when complete.

This system ensures efficient message handling and scalability for concurrent applications.
