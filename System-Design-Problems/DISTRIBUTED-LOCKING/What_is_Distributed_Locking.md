# Distributed Locking

Distributed locking is a mechanism used in distributed systems to ensure that only one process or node can access a shared resource at any given time. This is particularly important in systems with multiple services or nodes that might try to modify the same resource, such as a database record, file, or shared memory segment, which could lead to conflicts, data corruption, or inconsistent states.

## Key Concepts

1. **Exclusive Access**: The lock ensures that a shared resource is accessed exclusively by one process at a time, avoiding race conditions and conflicts.
2. **Coordination Across Nodes**: In a distributed environment, locking must account for multiple processes potentially running on different machines, requiring coordination mechanisms beyond a single machineâ€™s locking primitives.
3. **Fault Tolerance**: Distributed locks need mechanisms to handle node failures, such as releasing locks held by a failed node to avoid deadlocks.
4. **Timeouts and Leases**: To prevent a lock from being held indefinitely by a node that fails or hangs, locks are often granted for a specific duration (lease). After expiration, the lock is released automatically.

## Common Distributed Locking Mechanisms

1. **Database-based Locks**: Using a database to store lock states, where a lock is represented by a row in a table, and processes can insert or update the row to acquire or release the lock.
2. **ZooKeeper / etcd / Consul**: These are distributed consensus systems that can be used to manage locks reliably. Processes create or delete nodes (or keys) as a form of lock.
3. **Redis Locks**: Using Redis, a key-value store, to implement distributed locks by setting a key with an expiration time. The `SETNX` (set if not exists) command is often used for this purpose.
4. **Leader Election**: Sometimes, distributed locking is implemented as leader election, where one node becomes the "leader" and holds the lock. Other nodes check the leader's status to decide whether they can access the resource.

## Example Use Cases

- **Distributed Databases**: Coordinating updates to shared records in a database.
- **Microservices**: Ensuring only one instance of a microservice performs certain operations at any given time.
- **File Storage**: Managing exclusive access to files in a shared storage system.
